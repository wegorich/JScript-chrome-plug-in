JScript-chrome-plug-in
======================

Cool plugin for Chrome browser.

### What does it do?

U have got a site u using. But some time u need to remove something or fixed it too feel better. 

Good idea using user scripts for that. But it`s not so cool and easy.

This plugin try to help u. 

### What do u need?

* Site url or regexp
* Simple js code. And u can use Jquery for workind with dom;

### Bad news

This plugins UI was build with Knockout.js (it uses eval()) for binding. Latest Chrome doesn`t allowed that.
